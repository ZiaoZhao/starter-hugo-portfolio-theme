  In the past and until now, Belgium mainly had a mechanism in place that
  rewarded the PV energy production through feed-in tariffs that were attributed
  with a net annual balance counting. In Belgium, the mechanism of
  self-consumption for photovoltaic (PV) installations is projected to become
  mainstream. This change is going to have an important impact on the PV sector
  in Belgium. At the moment, there is a demand for a simple simulation tool that
  makes it possible to simulate the self-consumption ratio and the
  self-sufficiency ratio of a PV system or a group of PV systems in combination
  with one local consumption profile or a group of consumption profiles from the
  same neighborhood, in particular in the context of collective
  self-consumption. Indeed, combining different consumption profiles from the
  same neighborhood can significantly improve the self-consumption ratio to
  reduce the cost of a PV system for the users.

  A free web application has been provided to the public for such simulation[1].
